# Express-MVC-Framework
Express is a popular Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is widely used for creating RESTful APIs and web applications that can handle multiple routes, HTTP requests, and responses.

This project is an implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture using the Express framework. It provides a structure for organizing your code, separating the concerns of the different layers of your application, and making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Express MVC Framework, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Directory Structure
The directory structure of the project follows the MVC architecture, with separate directories for models, views, controllers, settings, assets, and system. The app.js file is the main entry point for the application, which initializes the Express app and in the seetings it sets up the middleware and routes.
